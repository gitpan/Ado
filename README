NAME
    Ado - busy or delaying activity; bustle; fuss.

DESCRIPTION
    Ado is a lightweight and reliable base for developing realtime web
    applications with database backend for the enterprise. Ado is based on
    Mojolicious and implements many of the recommendations from
    Mojolicious::Guides. When in doubt it is recommended to follow these
    recomendations.

    Ado adds some default configuration and a database schema. A default
    basic database is bundled in the distribution at etc/ado.sqlite to get
    you up to speed quickly. The used RDBMS is DBD::SQLite. Tables can be
    accessed and manipulated using DBI or any ORM. We prefer
    DBIx::Simple::Class trough Mojolicious::Plugin::DSC. DBIx::Simple::Class
    is a simple OM that provides representation of table records as plain
    Perl objects.

INSTALLATION
    Ado is meant to be installed into a folder of your choise. It can go
    into the "site" folder of your *non-system Perl distro* but better
    install it in its own folder.

    We do not recommend using Ado with your system Perl! Get a precompiled
    Perl distro from <http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads> for
    your OS or prepare your own using perlbrew.

    To install Ado after downloading, run the following commands:

      tar -zxf Ado-X.XX.tar.gz
      cd Ado-X.XX/
      perl Build.PL --install_base $HOME/path/to/ado
      #if run without --install_base $HOME/opt/ado will be suggested
      ./Build
      ./Build installdeps
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
    After installing, you can find documentation with the perldoc command.

        perldoc Ado
        perldoc Ado::Manual #this page

    For better experience run the "ado" application and read the
    documentation from your browser.

      $HOME/opt/ado/bin/ado daemon

    Go to http:/localhost:3000/perldoc

    You can report bugs and suggest features at
    <http://github.com/kberov/Ado/issues>. Bugs will be considered and fixed
    as time permits. Feel invited to make pull requests for your
    contributions.

REST API
    Ado strives for strict separation of concerns. As a result we came to
    the conclusion that the best way to achieve this is to fully separate
    the client from the server. Almost every resource is accessible via the
    REST API. We follow closely the recommendations from
    www.RestApiTutorial.com. See Ado::Manual::RESTAPI.
