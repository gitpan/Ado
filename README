NAME
  Ado::Manual - Getting started with Ado

SYNOPSIS
    ado daemon
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

DESCRIPTION
  Ado is a framework for web projects based on Mojolicious, written in the
  Perl programming language <http://www.perl.org/>.

  Ado is a typical Mojo application yet it adds some default configuration
  and a model layer - Mojolicious::Plugin::DSC. An SQLite database is
  bundled in the distribution at "etc/ado.sqlite" to get started quickly.

  Since version 0.37 Ado goes together with the following:

  *   Ado::Command::adduser allows adding users to an Ado application via a
      terminal. It also allows adding users to existing or not existing
      groups. The new group is automatically created.

  *   Ado::Plugin::Auth is a plugin that authenticates users to an Ado
      system. Users can be authenticated locally or using (TODO!) Facebook,
      Google, Twitter and other authentication service-providers.

  *   Ado::Plugin::MarkdownRenderer - Render static files in markdown
      format. You can create a personal blog or enterprise wiki using static
      files in markdown format. See the Functional documentation at
      <http://localhost:3000/help> for an example.

  *   PageDown <http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/> is the version of
      Attacklab's Showdown and WMD as used on Stack Overflow and the other
      Stack Exchange sites. It includes a converter that turns Markdown into
      HTML, a Markdown editor with realtime preview of the generated HTML,
      and a few useful plugins, e.g. for sanitizing the generated HTML
      according to a whitelist of allowed tags.

  *   Semantic UI <http://semantic-ui.com/> - A CSS and JS user interface
      framework. UI is the vocabulary of the web. Semantic empowers
      designers and developers by creating a language for sharing UI.

INSTALLATION
  We do not recommend using Ado with your system Perl!

  Get a precompiled Perl distro like "Citrus Perl"
  (<http://www.citrusperl.com/download.html>) or "ActivePerl Community
  Edition" (<http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads>) for your OS,
  or build your own using App::perlbrew.

  Ado can be downloaded from CPAN <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Ado/> and
  installed manually or installed directly from CPAN using "cpan" or "cpanm"
  commandline tools.

  Ado is meant to be *installed into a folder of your choice*. It can go
  into the "siteprefix" folder of your *non-system Perl distro* or in its
  own folder. When installing Ado in its own folder add the
  "/path/to/ado/bin" to your $PATH environment variable.

 MANUAL
  To install manually Ado after downloading, run the following commands:

    tar -zxf Ado-X.XX.tar.gz
    cd Ado-X.XX/
    perl Build.PL --install_base $HOME/opt/ado
    #or simply
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build installdeps
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

 CPAN
    cpanm Ado
    #or
    cpan[1]> install Ado
    Running install for module 'Ado'
    Running make for B/BE/BEROV/Ado-0.26.tar.gz
    ...  
    ...
      BEROV/Ado-0.26.tar.gz
    ./Build install install  -- OK

 PERLBREW
  Installing Ado under your own perlbrew environment

    perlbrew init
    perlbrew install -n perl-5.18.1 --as ado -j 3
    perlbrew switch ado
    perlbrew install-cpanm
    cpanm Ado

 Carton
  Installing Ado using Carton

    echo 'requires "Ado";' > cpanfile
    carton install
    carton exec local/bin/ado daemon

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
  After installing, you can find documentation with the perldoc command. To
  use "perldoc" for reading documentation you may need to add the full path
  to Ado "lib" directory to "PERL5LIB" environment variable in case you
  passed the "--install_base" to "Build.PL".

      perldoc Ado
      perldoc Ado::Manual #this page

  For better experience run the "ado" application and read the documentation
  from your browser.

    $HOME/opt/ado/bin/ado daemon

  If you installed "ado" in your Perl distro, you can simply type:

    ado daemon

  Go to http:/localhost:3000/perldoc

  You can report bugs and suggest features at
  <http://github.com/kberov/Ado/issues>. Bugs will be considered and fixed
  as time permits. Feel invited to make pull requests for your
  contributions.

CONTRIBUTING
  Of course anybody can contribute by reporting issues via github. To be
  able to contribute with code some rules need to be kept. This is mandatory
  for any community project. Generally the rules outlined in
  Mojolicious::Guides::Contributing apply for Ado too. For specific to Ado
  rules see Ado::Manual::Contributing.

  We expect that you know how to write perl Modules and are familiar with
  Mojolicious.

REST API
  Ado strives for strict separation of concerns. The best way to achieve
  this is to fully separate the client code from the server code. Ado is
  ideally suited for the purpose thanks to Mojolicious. Every resource is
  accessible via the REST API. We follow closely and elaborate on the
  recommendations in "RESTful Service Best Practices" at
  www.RestApiTutorial.com. See Ado::Manual::RESTAPI.

PLUGINS
  Ado plugins work the same way as Mojolicious::Plugins and share the same
  common base trough Ado::Plugin. Ado plugins have one small additional
  feature. They can load their own configuration from
  "$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/etc/plugins/plugin_name.conf". Business-specific
  applications for an Ado-based system are usually implemented as plugins.
  One way to contribute to Ado is by writing plugins.

  See Ado::Manual::Plugins and Ado::Plugin for more information.
