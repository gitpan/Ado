In this folder Ado keeps its configuration files.
Here we have also the database files which are distributed 
with Ado by default.

You may want to create environment specific versions of
ado.conf and ado.sqlite named after the environment e.g.
ado.development.conf and ado.development.sqlite or
ado.production.conf and ado.production.sqlite.
The environment specific files will be detected and used.

These files may be changed locally for experimenting but local 
changes usualy do not have to go upstream.

To ignore such files but keep them versioned
one have to run the command "git update-index".
Here is an example with ado.conf.
  git update-index --assume-unchanged etc/ado.conf

To make git track the file again, when you have a change 
that you want to push upstream, simply run:
  git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt.
